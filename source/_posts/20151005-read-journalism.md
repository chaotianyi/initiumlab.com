## Storytelling

A step-by-step guide for turning out great articles. The book provides beginners with a systematic approach to feature writing and new tricks.

Piecemeal advice about writing good screenplays that sell. May require some basic understanding of the structure and purposes of stories. Highly readable.

## Writing

The older version is better, as they’re free from revisionist tampering.

### On Writing
Written by Stephen King, an American novelist. This is more a memoir than it’s a textbook, but a substantial part is about use of the English and writing (fiction, mostly).

### On Writing Well

## Interviewing and Tradition of Journalism

Covers basic aspects of reporting about people.
