## Learn JavaScript like a Natural Language

Andy Shu, News Engineer with Initium Lab, shared his experience of migrating skills in Natural Language Acquisition to accelerate learning programming languages.

![Andy Shu talking about Learning JavaScript](/blog/20151105-barcamp-hk-2015/andy-barcamp-hk-javascript.jpg)

Andy outlined 6 tactics of natural language learning applicable to learning programming languages.

The first is to get to the "minimallly viable proficiency" as soon as possible, at which point the language becomes useful to the learner. After that point, learning turns self-sustainable as learning directly brings benefits.

The second is spaced repetition, which basically says you should review materials often in small chuncks, rather than trying to memorize everything in one shot.

The third is "comprehensible input + 1", meaning the learners should try to read materials slightly above their level, rather than dwelling in their comfort zone.

The fourth is using existing mental models to understand unfamiliar concepts.

The fifth is shadow writing, which refers to the exercises of writing code and compare it with exemplary code.

The sixth is learning with others.

The slides with details about the learning strategies are available here:

## Cold Knowledge on QRCode

Hu Pili talked about the less known side of QR Code, for example, QRCode can be hacked and direct to another URL if someone filling originally blank cells.

He also demonstrated how to make functional QRCodes with image patterns.

IT如何幫助基督教的民主化
Franky-春天教會

梁：應該說15年免費教育

香港35萬基督教
一半天主教 一半新教

在投選委：有多少人？試玩多
要教會endorse你，要是教友才行
最高票的七千多
最少上線的的三千多——三千多就可以做選委

可能有十幾萬雨傘基督徒——他們能夠改變世界

梁美芬的教會——用惡劣的方法去投票
崇拜的時候：我們一起舉手吧，有人幫你做票

你原本可以投10個人，結果只投1個

大教會就贏了

「基督教協進會」——法定組織機構

理念：有牧師跑出來，叫大家不要搞那麼多政治——問題是，他們只在宗教上有授權，沒有在政治有授權

技術上怎麼辦：
可不可以多點票站？
監察票站

討論政綱？

基督教討論政治風氣差：要不不理你，要不很極端；

教會應該有一個新的平臺去討論政治

戴耀庭搞deliberation也好，雖然也有不少限制

觀眾：在臺灣分享Open Source，很多時技術不是最重要的，大家都是用Facebook、Whatsapp、Telegram而已
很多時候缺的不是Platform，而是大家有沒有時間交待清楚，為什麼我要做這件事
越講得清楚

觀眾：給她滿額一個Secret Page，講心底話，開個論壇

教會——性工作去無名化

教會沒法對教友地產商講道，畢竟每年捐幾百萬，你一講「剝削」，他就走了，怎麼講？

Open Source

PHP is the best language

PHP is old? -> JS is also old!

Many senior PHP dev think PHP === WordPress

PHP has changed a lot since the last few yers


anonymous functions
arrays with square brackets []

PHAR -> just like JAR

Facebook: HHVM

PHP7 (there is no PHP6)

talks.php.net/fluet15

PHP-FIG for interoperability

Package manager: composer, packagist

Autoloader
(WordPress doesn't work)

Silex -> like express
Laravel -> like Rails
ReactPHP -> event-driven & non-blocking I/O just like Node.js
Symfony -> a component library and a framework

PHPUnit

PHPSpec

Behat (for BDD)

Profiling: blackfire

HK80 assumes the world is flat

The resolution of HK80 is much better than WGS84

Convertion: Geodetic Datum Transformation Tool

?How did you get the base map; any special requirements ?
?Why use Windows?

Google Chrome plugin -> Geojson mapper?

Why is the Internet so slow?

100 MB
