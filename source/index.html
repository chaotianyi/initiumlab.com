                According to the voting records, although no motion amendment from Poon Siu-ping got supported, through secret ballot his motion on Occupational Safety has been adopted. Poon replied to us that there is no fundamental disagreement between Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions (FTU) and Federation of Hong Kong and Kowloon Labour Unions (FLU), as FTU is also on pro-establishment camp. However, Poon  didn’t think it would be easy to have their support. “To improve labour rights and benefits, one  has to change the consistently business-oriented operating environment, while in many legislators of functional constituency  represents business interests and they are naturally unlikely to support motions protecting labour rights.”
