Data is critical to Journalism. We are building an internal database to collect all kinds of data. Machine readable and structured data is readily available to journalists and researchers at Initium Lab. The database is now 800MB in size containing 84 public/ internal datasets. The areas are diversified including political data, environmental data, social development data, publication data, etc.

The database is constantly growing. We are open to collaboration of all forms. Collection, cross validation, dataset exchange, and buying / selling datasets are all possible. Contact us if you are interested.
